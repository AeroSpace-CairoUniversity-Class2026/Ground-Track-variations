# Ground Track With different methods:

#### in this repo we will discuss how to build a fround track for any satellites in two different ways:

+ **Using TLE**
+ **using State vectors**

#### we will also discuss how to build such visualization using two different programming languages:

+ **Python**
+ **MATLAB**

the target of this repo is to provide insight on how such tracker could be biuld in various ways and compare the efficiency and the time consumption between two programming languages (Python & MATLAB).
the most important acpect in this repo is maintenance, as this couldd will be updated regulary for both developemnt and bugs fixation.

> for now we have uploaded the initial code only for python in TLE format and the State Vectors one in MATLAB

> it will be great start for you to see the folders and codes, determining what could be done to enhance or update the code: adding 3D model, adding animations, building GUI, ... and etc!

>stay tuned!!
