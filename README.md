# Ground Track for different satellites:

#### in this repo me and my collegue will discuss how to build a fround track for any satellites in two different ways:

+ **Using TLE**
+ **using State vectors**

#### and we will discuss how to build such visualization using two different programming languages:

+ **Python**
+ **MATLAB**

the target of this repo is to provide insight on how such tracker could be biuld in various ways and compare the efficiency and the time consumption between two programming languages (Python & MATLAB).
the most important acpect in this repo is maintenance, as this couldd will be updated regulary for both developemnt and bugs fixation.

> for now we have uploaded the initial code only for python in TLE format

>stay tuned!!
